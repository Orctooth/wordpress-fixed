The file path has to be changed to 'htdocs/wordpressSite/wordpress' for the project to run properly

I was discussing in the Discord how I will be fixing this issue when uploading the project to cpanel as apparently changing the url in wordpress is somewhat difficult. For now, changing the url manually should have everthing working as intended.
